help life scientists to conveniently connect various programs and web services. In practice however, much time is spent on data conversion, because web services provided by different organisations use different data formats. We have analysed all the Taverna workflows available at the myExperiment web site on December 11, 2008. Our analysis of the tasks in these workflows shows several noticeable aspects: their number ranges from 1 to 70 tasks per workflow; 18% of the workflows consist of a single task.

Of the tasks used are 22% web services; local services, i.e.
tasks executed by the workflow system itself, are very popular and cover 57% of tasks; tasks implemented by the workflow designer, scripting tasks, are is also used often (14%). Our analysis shows that over 30% of tasks are related to dataconversion.}

@misc{Matthews,
	Abstract = {Only a small part of the research which has been carried out to date on the preservation of digital objects has looked specifically at the preservation of software. This is because the preservation of software has been seen as a less urgent problem than the preservation of other digital objects, and also the complexity of software artifacts makes the problem of preserving them a daunting one. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to want to preserve software. In this paper we consider some of the motivations behind software preservation, based on an analysis of software preservation practice. We then go on to consider what it means to preserve software, discussing preservation approaches, and developing a performance model which determines how the adequacy of the a software preservation method. Finally we discuss some implications for preservation analysis for the case of software artifacts.},
