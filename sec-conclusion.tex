\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%\feedback{@Oscar: this conclusion section is missing a statement (paragrph) of what can be derived from the experiments run, on what are the envisaged challenges that %you foresee, etc.}

%\feedback{@Oscar: Something that should be discussed in a discussion or future
%work section is how we can build a library of descriptions for all the workflows
%in the world (is it possible? how many descriptions can be reused? how much reuse?}

In this work, we proposed a semantic modeling approach to conserve computational environments in scientific workflow executions, where  the resources involved in the execution of the experiment are described using a set of semantic vocabularies. We defined and implemented 4 domain ontologies, aggregated in the the WICUS ontology network. From these models, we defined a process for documenting workflow applications, the workflow management system where they can be executed, and their dependencies. 

We conducted experiments with three workflow applications from different areas of science (Montage, Epigenomics and SoyKB) using the Pegasus WMS. We executed the ISA to obtain a set of PRECIP and Vagrant scripts to describe and execute the experiment. Experimental results show that our approach can reproduce an equivalent execution environment of a predefined VM image on academic, public, and local Cloud platforms.

Semantic annotations of the computational environment, combined with the ISA and the scripting functionality provided by PRECIP and Vagrant, is a powerful approach for achieving reproducibility of computational environments in future experiments, and at the same time addresses the challenges of high storage demand of VM images. The drawback of our approach is that it assumes that the application and the workflow management system binaries are publicly available.

The results of this work also show how components, such as the workflow system, can be annotated once and then reused among workflows. We envision a library of workflow descriptions in which components and tools can be easily reused, even during the development process of the workflow. Many workflows are built upon previous workflows, especially within the context of a scientific domain, and hence having such type of library would be helpful. We plan to study how and when those libraries can be built, analyzing their degree of reuse. \rev{As introduced in this work, our descriptions of the environment, generated using the WICUS ontology network, is compliant with the Linked Data principles. This would allow its future publication and integration with other information sources, which fits the idea of a distributed and structured library of descriptions that could be publicly available worldwide.}

\rev{We are currently studying the applicability of our approach to other workflows, belonging to other scientific areas, and applying it to new workflow management systems. Even thought the cloud systems included in this work cover a representative spectrum of cloud providers, we are studying its applicability to other cloud scenarios and emerging container-based solutions.}  We will also work on increasing  the degree of automation of the semantic annotation process to describe both the workflow application and the workflow management system. As introduced in this work, WICUS is an ongoing effort, thus we also plan to extend the ontology network to include new concepts and relations such as software variants, incompatibilities, and user policies for resource consumption.
